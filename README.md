[View the English list](/free-science-books.md)

## Intro

This list was inspired by [free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/). A few of us decided to try it for Science books.


### How To Contribute

It's [easy](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/wiki/Contribution). Please read [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
- Read the [TODO](/TODO.md) file(adding new books is our #1 priority, but things like Alphabetizing are important, too.)
- [Edit](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-science-books/edit/master/free-science-books.md) (we prefer multiple small commits rather than one large change)
- [Send a PR](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
- Be part of a great project!

**Again, unlike other projects, we prefer multiple small commits rather than one large change in a pull request - it's fine to have one PR, but please make sure your title reflects what you're changing**, thanks.
